## Virtual Reality Modelling -- Lab 1
In this lab, you will have to set up your Git repository and your project and add some models
to your virtual scene.

## Task

Choose an environment and create a virtual scene of it in Godot or another game engine.
The environment can be a room in your house, an office, a small outdoor scene. You can
use third-party models (from Sketchfab, CGTrader, or anywhere else) and models that you
create yourself. Requirements:
● The environment’s project is in a hosted repository.
● The environment consists of at least 10 models.
○ The models have to be listed in a text file in the repository (the name and the
link from where it’s been downloaded).
● Have textured materials.
● Have collisions that meet the object’s shape.
